# Chrome Activity Samples

Let your browser record the activities you want to remember tonight.

## Why?

Maybe you know this: you work on different stuff all the day and at the end of the day you forgot what you did. Or when. 
This extension turns time recording around: instead of remembering yourself to track your time your browser asks you periodically: "What are you doing right now?". Just answer this question if you want or don't if you are in flow or whatever.

## How?

Just define the timeframe for being asked about the actual activity in the options. Then a small form will popup periodically. It will automatically go away after some seconds or by using the ESC key. Write a little note into the field if you want, it last's just a moment. If you don't (e.g. because your activity has not changed since the last record) it's just fine.

## Motivation

Once I read an interesting article (https://ralfw.de/2017/08/zeiterfassung-mit-activity-sampling) where the author describes
* the motivations and needs for time recordings
* the frustration about existing time recording tools
* the idea behind push versus pull time recording

The domain seems simple enough to use it in training projects. Since I wanted to learn a bit about the development of browser extensions it seemed to be a good way to combine learning and doing something useful :).

## Installation

This extension is not available via Google Web Store since it is not considered ready for being published. If you want to give it a try you need to clone the repository and add the code manually to the browser as described e.g. here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

## Future

Right now there are some ideas I will work on in the future ... probably ;)

* I want to see, to which date the activity belongs (right now only times are saved).
* I want to copy the recorded data to put it into other tools.
* I want some nice, simple and easy UI.
* I want to use this extension on my Firefox as well.
* I want to learn more about extension development :)
* I want to install this extension via the browsers web stores.
